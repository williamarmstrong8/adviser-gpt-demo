    question: "What specific pre-approval requirements must Granite Peak employees adhere to when using AI Systems involving proprietary information, and what roles do the Deputy CCO and Director of Operations play in the due diligence process to prevent unauthorized sharing of confidential information?",
    answer: "II. PRE-APPROVAL REQUIREMENT Granite Peak employees are prohibited from using any AI Systems involving the consumption of data or proprietary information related to Granite Peak's business without specific authorization from the Deputy CCO and the Director of Operations. Once notified, these officers will be responsible for conducting due diligence on the specific AI System for several purposes, including but not limited to avoiding the inappropriate or unauthorized sharing of confidential information, and avoiding the unintended loss of intellectual property. IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHETHER USE OF ANY AI SYSTEM REQUIRES PRE-APPROVAL, PLEASE CONTACT THE DEPUTY CCO. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE AN ASSUMPTION. III. PRESENT AUTHORIZED USE AND MONITORING Granite Peak employees may use AI Systems for general business purposes, including but not limited to research, analysis, and communication, provided that such use does not involve the input of confidential or proprietary information related to Granite Peak's business.",
